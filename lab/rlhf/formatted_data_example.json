However, slugs and other mollusks can also have negative impacts on crops and gardens, and can spread harmful organisms. It is generally best to allow these species to occur naturally in ecosystems, while taking steps to minimize any negative impacts on nearby agricultural systems. Human intervention and control of slug populations is generally not recommended, and disruption of natural ecological systems and protocols is generally discouraged."
